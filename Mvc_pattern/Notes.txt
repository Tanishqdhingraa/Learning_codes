Request → Route → Controller → Model → Controller → Response


MVC stands for Model–View–Controller.
It is a design pattern used to organize backend applications by 
separating responsibilities.
Model handles the data and database logic.
View is what the client sees (in backend APIs, this is usually the JSON response).
Controller contains the business logic and connects the Model with the View.

How we use it:
In Express apps, routes receive requests, controllers process the logic, models interact with 
the database, and the controller sends a response back to the client.

Why we use it:
We use MVC to keep code clean, modular, and scalable. It makes the project easier to maintain, 
debug, and work on in a team because each part has a clear responsibility.
